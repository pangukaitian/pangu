# Welcome to Pangu Research Lab

The Pangu Lab focuses on quality assurance of classic and non-classic software systems, including:

-   Quantum programs
-   Deep learning systems
-   Hybrid systems (a.k.a. Cyber-physical systems)
-   Autonomous vehicles

The overall goal of Pangu Research Lab is to ensure the safe application and deployment of software systems, making them more robust, reliable, secure and easier to specify, build, maintain, or improve.
